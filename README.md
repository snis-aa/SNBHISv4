#SOCIAL NETWORK BASE ON  HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM

                                   SOCIAL NETWORK BASE ON  HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM


Health is very important to all people. The spread of the doctors and hospitals contributed significantly to save people from death or serious diseases, but in some cases of medical mistakes are caused either serious injury or sometimes death .
 The  medical mistakes in the recent years has increased dramatically because of the weakness of either doctors or lack of attention to patients .
To avoid medical mistakes the people go for consultation about the  hospitals from the people who went to that hospital , but this solution has many weakness  the most important that it is possible to get a conflict of opinion or lack of the people who have your  disease .
In our project we offer a new solution that integrates social networking with health concerns . we offer a program that combines all hospitals and doctors in the hospitals and displays itâ€™s  rating, the rating is done by the users After they went to the hospital and had  their experience with  the doctor for the benefit of other people.

we hope to offer very helpful program to all the people and maintain the human life and offer a useful program for our community .
